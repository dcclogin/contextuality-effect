# Contextuality Effect

Here we propose a constructive, non-local hidden variable model based on various computational effects with Haskell implementation. It is designed to simulate and account for some "mysterious phenomenons" in quantum physics when it comes to observation and measurement, namely non-locality and contextuality, as revealed by Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem and its loophole-free experiments.
