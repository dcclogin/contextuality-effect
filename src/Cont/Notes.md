### TODOs

In this model, each quantum particle is represented as a coroutine (YieldT) that suspends its execution at the point of measurement, awaiting the decision of its entangled partner. The function src, which acts as a Judge, embodies a subtle yet profound idea: each particle “borrows” the future decision of the other via continuation, as seen in k1 pixel2 and k2 pixel1, which resume their computation using the other’s locally rendered output. The race between these two suspended continuations simulates the indeterminate ordering of measurement events — whichever completes first determines the outcome, retroactively influencing the result of the other. Thus, the past rendering (mine1, mine2) of a particle’s value is updated based on information received from the future behavior of its entangled twin. This interplay between borrowed futures and revised pasts mirrors interpretations of quantum mechanics that allow for retrocausality: outcomes are not strictly determined by past events alone but emerge from a global consistency enforced across time, like a tapestry woven from both ends.
